/* 
The call() method explicitly sets the this value of the function to be called and allows passing 
arguments individually. 

Apply is very similar to the call function. The only difference is that in apply you can pass an 
array as an argument list. 

Bind is a function that helps you create another function that you can execute later with the new
context of this that is provided
*/

let nameObj = {
  firstname: "Tommy",
  lastname: "Ben",
};

let fullname = function (city, pincode) {
  console.log(
    this.firstname + " " + this.lastname + " from " + city + ", " + pincode
  );
};

// call method --> function borrowing
fullname.call(nameObj, "Chennai", "12345"); // Pass the object and other arguments

// apply method --> similar to .call() method
fullname.apply(nameObj, ["Mumbai", "24523"]); // Pass the object and other arguments in an array

// bind method -->
let fullnameMethod = fullname.bind(nameObj, "Delhi", "09890");
fullnameMethod();

/*
 * Common Use Cases:
 *
 * Setting 'this' Value: All three methods can be used to explicitly set the 'this' value of the function
 * being called.
 *
 * Handling Events: Event handlers often need to bind specific 'this' values for proper context.
 *
 * Creating Constructor Functions: Constructor functions use call() or apply() to create new instances
 * of objects.
 *
 * Currying: Currying involves partially applying arguments to a function and returning a new function
 * that takes the remaining arguments.
 *
 * Generic Functions: Generic functions can be written to work with different types of data by using
 * bind() to set the this value appropriately.
