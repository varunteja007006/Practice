### Change the root user & password

Check for the user
`Here root can be your system user login name - john therefore replace root with your username`  
Still confused ?? open your terminal and type the below command to know the username

```sh
whoami
```

 <br />

1. Access mysql shell

```sh
sudo mysql
```

2. Run the following commands

```sh
USE mysql;
```

Back to MySQL

```sh
SELECT user FROM mysql.user WHERE user = 'root' AND Host = 'localhost';
```

#### _If the user does not exist_

```sh
CREATE USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
```

In place of `'new_password'` give your desired password.

Grant all the privileges

```sh
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost';
```

```sh
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### _If the user already exists_

```sh
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
```

3. Exit and restart

```sh
EXIT;
```

```sh
sudo systemctl restart mysql
```

4. Test with new password

```sh
mysql -u root -p
```
