# SQL Notes

## Handling timezones

- Always store date and time in UTC.
- Convert to local time only for display purposes.
- Store user timezone to convert back to local time.
- Store the IANA timezone name (e.g., "America/New_York") in the database. A standard full timezone name. 32 characters (as per 2025).

- Don't rely on db server timezone.
- Don't use server side functions to convert time to local time.
- Grouping data by day? Convert to one timezone.
- Watch out for daylight saving time.
