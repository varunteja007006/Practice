# Practice Repo

This repo is my playground / notes for the technologies I learn. It helps me refer back to
sample code snippets and concept definitions when I need them.

## Conventions

### Naming

- Folders: lowercase kebab-case (`js-basics/`, `system-design/`, `linked-list/`).
- Files: lowercase kebab-case (`mysql-setup.md`, `js-is-weird.md`). No spaces, no ALL-CAPS.
- Sequential notes use zero-padded numeric prefixes (`01-`, `02-`, ...), e.g. `notes/05-kafka.md`.
- Assets live in an `assets/` subfolder next to the notes that reference them.
- Sub-projects named after their own topic only when the parent already gives context
  (`rust/basics/`, not `rust/rust_basics/`).
- Never rename files inside cloned third-party repos — it breaks their internals.

### Structure

- One top-level folder per topic; notes, code, and assets for a topic live together.
- Cross-cutting topics (security, practices) go in `notes/`.
- Editor setup and machine config go in `config/`, shared images in `assets/`.

### Hygiene

- Build artifacts are not committed: `dist/`, `build/`, compiled binaries, `coverage/`.
- One lockfile per project (pnpm preferred), don't commit `node_modules/`.
- Markdown must pass `markdownlint` (see `.markdownlint.jsonc`): no inline HTML
  (`<br />`), no bare URLs, blank lines around headings/lists/fences.
- Don't commit secrets — `.env*` is gitignored.
