# Install Mongodb

### Lingo

Let us first understand the MongoDB language.

- document - It means same as record in MySQL
- collections - It means same as table in MySQL

### Documentation

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/installation/

# Run Mongodb (Linux Terminal)

To start the mongodb:

```sh
sudo systemctl start mongod
```

To check if mongodb started / status:

```sh
sudo systemctl status mongod
```

Stop mongodb:

```sh
sudo systemctl stop mongod
```

Restart mongodb:

```sh
sudo systemctl restart mongod
```

# MongoDB Shell

You can run the MongoDB shell in the linux terminal after starting the MongoD service as shown the
above section `Run MongoDB (Linux Terminal)`.

### Documentation

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/run-commands/

To refer more methods

https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/method/

Start the mongodb shell:

```sh
mongosh
```

Help in mongodb shell:

```sh
help
```

Clear the mongodb shell:

```sh
cls
```

Terminate the running command or query:

> ctrl+c

### Simple Queries

Current Database - To print current database type the following command

```sh
db
```

Show all databases

```sh
show dbs
```

Use or switch to a different database

```sh
use accounts
```

This creates a database named accounts or switches to existing database.

Create new db & collection ( Insert a document into collection to create collection )

```sh
use accounts
```

```js
db.employees.insertOne({ name: "John" });
```

Show all collections

```sh
show collections
```

Rename the collection

```js
db.employees.renameCollection("users");
```

Delete a document from collection who's name is `Tommy`

```js
db.users.remove({ name: "Tommy" });
```

Drop the collection

```js
db.collection.drop();
```

Drop the database

```js
db.dropDatabase();
```

Lets set up the database once again since we dropped it in the before section.about-image

```sh
use accounts
```

Now proceed with following `insertOne` or `insertMany` operation to create a collection as well a document
in the collection.

# MongoDB VSCode Extension

You can also use your VSCode extension to learn MongoDB.

After starting the MongoDB shell using `mongosh`

You can find a url as shown below,<br />
`Connection to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/?directConnection=true&serverSelectionTimeoutMS=2000&appName=mongosh+2.1.1` <br />
or something similar. Keep a copy of this string which is a url that will be used later.

<br>

#### Install the MongoDB for VS Code extension.

Install the MongoDB for VS Code extension. To proceed further.

![MongoDB Extension for VS Code](https://github.com/varunteja007006/Practice/blob/main/Practice%20MongoDB/assets/mongodb_extensionForVSCode.png?raw=true)

<br>

#### Access MongoDB extension in VS Code.

Access the extension from the VS Code side menu.
![Access MongoDB Extension for VS Code](https://github.com/varunteja007006/Practice/blob/main/Practice%20MongoDB/assets/mongodb_accessExtension.png?raw=true)

<br>

Click `Add Connection` button in the `connections`
![Add Connection in MongoDB](https://github.com/varunteja007006/Practice/blob/main/Practice%20MongoDB/assets/mongodb_addConnection.png?raw=true)

Now you can see that it shows `üî¥ Not connected` and a `Connect` button below with text - "Connect with
Connection String"

<br>

Click on the `Connect` button and it will ask you for the url (the one generated when we run the mongodb shell). Paste it and press enter.
![Add url in MongoDB](https://github.com/varunteja007006/Practice/blob/main/Practice%20MongoDB/assets/mongodb_connectionURL.png?raw=true)

<br>

Once successful you can see that you are connected to MongoDB on local server.
![Connection successful](https://github.com/varunteja007006/Practice/blob/main/Practice%20MongoDB/assets/mongodb_connectionSuccess.png?raw=true)

<br>

#### MongoDB playground

To run the mongodb commands we need to create a file with the following file-naming convention `<filename>.mongodb.js`

For example: playground-01.mongodb.js, sample.mongodb.js, etc....

How does the code inside these files look?? Well not much different here is the sample code for
`playground-01.mongodb.js` file:

```js
// Select the database to use.
use("accounts");

// Select the collection to use and query.
db.getCollection("users").find({ personID: 1 }); // this queries document who's personID is 1
```

<br>
There you go, now you can create as many playground files as needed to test and learn MongoDB. üòÅ
<br>

### More Concepts in MongoDB

**Cursor**

When the db. collection. find () function is used to search for documents in the collection, the result returns a pointer to the collection of documents returned which is called a cursor. By default, the cursor will be iterated automatically when the result of the query is returned

src: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/js-cursor/

## Sample Data

    NOTE: Just type db.users.insertMany() in the terminal, now paste the below data and then close it with ).
