fn main() {
    println!("Welcome to Ownership in Rust");
}
// RUST Ownership concept

// It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.
// Some features to be covered:
// 1. borrowing
// 2. slices

// Rust's approach to Memory: memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of 
// rules that the compiler checks.f any of the rules are violated, the program wonâ€™t compile.
