### What Can You Build Using Rust?

Rust, known for its performance, safety, and memory management capabilities, offers a wide range of project possibilities. Here are some ideas to consider:

1. CLI Applications: Rust is excellent for building Command Line Interface (CLI) tools. These can range from simple utilities to more complex applications like event generators

2. Web Backends: Rust is well-suited for web backends, with frameworks like Rocket and Actix making development easy and efficient.

3. Front-End Web Apps: Consider using Yew, a Rust framework for front-end web app development.

4. Game Development: For small games, QuickSilver is a Rust game engine that compiles to both desktop and web platforms from the same codebase.

5. Cross-Platform GUI Apps: Rust is also suitable for developing cross-platform GUI applications, although the state of cross-platform GUI in Rust may require further exploration.

6. Machine Learning: While machine learning already has optimized C packages with Python bindings, exploring machine learning projects in Rust can be a performance-sensitive option.

7. These project ideas cater to various domains and showcase the versatility of Rust as a programming language.
