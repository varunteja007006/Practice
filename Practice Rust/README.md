# Rust
### Intro



### My Fisrst Program
```rs
# main.rs
fn main(){
    println!("Hello world");
}
```
Here `!` after println means it is a macro not a function. 

### Cargo Tool
As the project grows we should be able to compile and share the executable. Hence we will have to check
the cargo tool.

Cargo is Rustâ€™s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this tool to manage their Rust 
projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for you, such as building your code, downloading the 
libraries your code depends on, and building those libraries. (We call the libraries that your code 
needs dependencies.)

```rs
cargo new hello_cargo
```
