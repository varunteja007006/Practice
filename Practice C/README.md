# C Programming

I have avoided it at all costs during my initial computer science studies, but now after having a dip
at high level programming languages it kind of fascinates me to dwell a little into the low level.
Therefore just giving another shot at C. Also I am learning Rust and I thought I might as well check
it in parallel since Rust is built with memory safety and other features that C does not offer.

### Official Resources:

1. **The C Programming Language (K&R):** This classic book by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie is
   considered the definitive guide to C and is a must-read for any serious C programmer.

2. **GNU C Library Reference Manual:** This extensive manual documents the GNU C Library, which provides essential functions for most C programs.

3. **C Standard (ISO/IEC 9899):** While not exactly a tutorial, the official C standard defines the
   language's syntax and semantics, making it a valuable reference.

### Interactive Tutorials and Courses:

1. C Programming Tutorial on Learn-c.org: This free, interactive tutorial covers the basics of C
   programming in a browser-based environment.

2. CS50's Introduction to Computer Science: This Harvard University course, available on EdX, uses
   C to teach fundamental programming concepts.

3. HackerRank's C Practice Problems: This platform offers various C challenges to test your
   understanding and apply your skills in a hands-on way.
